# ZenOS-AI Security Model — GA Reference

**Version:** 4.5.5 'Ready Player Two' GA
**Status:** Operational reference — describes what is active at GA and what is stubbed for SP1

---

## The Short Version

ZenOS-AI has a complete security architecture. At GA, the structural layer is fully wired —
identity, principal chains, delegation limits, group nesting rules, and the claims engine
are all in place and enforced. The external authentication provider is not yet connected.

One drawer setting activates full enforcement at SP1: `secure: true` in the System Cabinet
`security_policy` drawer. Everything else is already running.

---

## What Is Active at GA

### Identity and Principal Resolution

Every principal — human or AI — has:

- A stable GUID and identity hash
- A cabinet drawer (AI User, Family, or User cabinet depending on type)
- A provenance record: origin system, household, family
- An essence capsule: identity, personality, capabilities, lineage

The identity tool (`zen_dojotools_identity`) resolves the full principal chain at runtime:
HA user → Household → Head of Household → AI GUID. This chain is the trust spine.

### Three-Layer Identity Schema

Identity records follow the canonical three-layer structure:

```
Layer 1: familiar     — runtime name, species, role (what Friday calls herself)
Layer 2: companion    — operational capsule: traits, lineage, directives, capabilities
Layer 3: jacket       — provenance: GUID, origin, signature, signed_by, signed_at
```

The jacket is the trust anchor. The familiar is the persona surface. The companion is what
the model reasons from.

### Prompt Integrity — `sensor.zen_prompt_health`

Every AI user cabinet has a prompt health sensor that reports:

| State | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `ok` | Three-layer schema + md5 signature + manifest present |
| `warn` | Signature pending or manifest missing |
| `error` | Legacy schema, missing essence, or cabinet unavailable |

The `prompt_health_check()` macro (in `zen_os_1.jinja`) is the single source of truth.
The sensor and the identity tool's `mode: prompt` both surface from it.

### Delegation and Nesting Hard Rules

Two structural limits are active and enforced at GA:

- **`max_delegation_depth: 2`** — A principal cannot delegate through more than 2 hops.
  Claims at depth 3+ are treated as absent (silent, not errored).
- **`max_nesting_depth: 2`** — Group nesting ceiling. A Family group can contain members
  and subgroups, but ZQ-1 resolution walks at most 2 levels deep.

These are not configuration — they are hard constants in the resolution engine.

### caller_token Plumbing

All 15 AI-accessible DojoTools scripts accept and echo a `caller_token` field. The field
is a noop at GA — it passes through and is reflected in the response. The plumbing path
from MCP tool call through to response is complete. SP1 enforcement requires no changes
to script internals.

### Profile Snapshot and Restore

The profile editor (`zen_dojotools_profile`) now snapshots `zenai_essence` →
`zenai_essence_prev` before every write. A `mode: restore` call rolls back to the last
known good state. `mode: read` surfaces `prev_snapshot_exists` so you can inspect before
committing. The audit trail is written as HA events (`essence_backed_up`,
`essence_restored`).

## The `security_policy` Drawer — What Is Stubbed

The System Cabinet carries a `security_policy` drawer. Fields active at GA are enforced
now. Fields marked SP1 are plumbed but are a no-op until SP1 activates them.

```yaml
security_policy:
  secure: false           # GA: active. false = enforcement off. true activates SP1 mode.
  max_delegation_depth: 2 # GA: active. Hard limit — enforced now.
  max_nesting_depth: 2    # GA: active. Hard limit — enforced now.

  # SP1 fields — plumbed, documented, not enforced until secure: true
  provider: ""            # authentik | oidc | custom
  token_endpoint: ""      # required when provider is set
  validation_mode: ""     # oidc | fido2 | custom
  claims_cache_ttl: 300   # session claims TTL in seconds
```

**Populating the SP1 fields at GA is a no-op.** They are stored but not read by any
enforcement path. Do not populate them and expect enforcement — it is not active.

---

## What Activates at SP1

Setting `secure: true` in `security_policy` is the single activation gate for the full
enforcement layer. When active:

- `caller_token` field is validated against the external provider
- Claims are resolved via the HyperIndex fold on the principal entity
- Tool access is gated by the resolved claim set
- Family cabinet `partner_registry` and AI jacket `principals[]` are cross-validated
- Delegation chain depth is checked at claim resolution time (already enforced structurally)

**ZenOS is the policy plane. The external provider is the auth plane.** The provider is
pluggable — the interface is the same regardless of whether you wire Authentik, a custom
OIDC stack, or something else. ZenOS does not care what's behind the endpoint, only that
the token validates.

---

## The Claims Engine — HyperIndex

The HyperIndex is the claims resolution engine at SP1. An index fold on a principal entity
produces a canonical claims dict from the label graph. ZQ-1 reads that dict at compile time
— that IS the authorization context for the call.

No separate claims service is required. The label graph already encodes the authorization
structure. The fold is the resolution step.

At GA, the index fold runs for context assembly. At SP1, the same fold runs for claims —
same engine, different consumer.

---

## Family and Partnership Registry (SP1 Schema — Stubbed at GA)

The Family Cabinet carries two new drawers with schema defined but not yet enforced:

**`family_registry`** — M:N human membership:
```json
{
  "members": [
    { "person": "<entity_id>", "role": "member|hoh|guest", "household": "<guid>" }
  ]
}
```

**`partner_registry`** — M:N AI partnership:
```json
{
  "partnerships": [
    { "ai": "<guid>", "principals": ["<guid>"], "role": "aipartner|prime_ai" }
  ]
}
```

Bidirectional validation at SP1: the AI jacket `principals[]` field and the family
`partner_registry` must agree. If they diverge, the claim is rejected.

---

## ACL Hierarchy

When a principal requests access to a drawer, the resolution order is:

1. Drawer-level ACL (most specific — wins)
2. Cabinet-level ACL
3. Family group policy
4. Household policy
5. Global restrictions (deny always overrides allow)

This hierarchy is the structural spec at GA. Enforcement at the tool layer activates at SP1.

## For Operators: What You Need to Know at GA

**You don't need to configure anything for security at GA.** The defaults are safe:

- `secure: false` means the enforcement gate is open — your AI has full access to what
  it's exposed to, scoped by labels and cabinets as designed.
- Delegation and nesting limits are enforced structurally regardless.
- Prompt integrity is monitored — `sensor.zen_prompt_health` tells you if something
  is wrong with the identity capsule before the agent starts reasoning from a broken state.

**When SP1 ships**, you will populate `provider` and `token_endpoint`, set `secure: true`,
and the system activates. No architectural changes required — the plumbing is already there.
