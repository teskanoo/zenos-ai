## Test Summary

### Provisioner (expansion_cabinet_1)
- `online_unmounted` → `provision` → `online_mounted` ✓
- GUID stamped, profile loaded, `zen_user_cabinet` label applied ✓
- `deprovision` → `online_unmounted`, verified ✓
- Occupied-cab guard: blocks slam on `online_mounted` ✓
- Auto-stamp: `init` → auto-stamp → `online_unmounted` → provision ✓

### Reload persistence
- Provision → `ha_reload_all` → state survives as `online_mounted` ✓
- No `restore: true` required — HA preserves in-memory state across reloads ✓

### Cabinet state machine
- One-write-behind fix: state evaluates post-write `_eff`, not pre-write `current` ✓
- `homeassistant.start` trigger: `event: start` (not `started`) ✓
- All 20 cabinet entity IDs align with friendly names ✓

### Index + history
- Label resolution, expand_entities, `+history` (24h buckets) all green ✓
- Stats-eligibility gate correct ✓

### Agent health
- Monastery degraded state surfaces as `ready_monastery_<state>` not `ready` ✓
