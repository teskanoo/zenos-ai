# Zen DojoTools Inspect — 4.2.2
**File:** `zen_dojotools_inspect_readme.md`  
**Type:** Technical Documentation  

---

## Overview

The **Zen DojoTools Inspect** module is ZenOS-AI’s structured introspection engine.  
It performs a safe, deterministic deep dive on one or more Home Assistant entities,
returning a sanitized, LLM-safe snapshot of everything an agent is allowed to see.

Its mission is simple and strict:

> **Show everything that is safe to show.  
> Never reveal anything that could break the system.  
> Never mutate anything.  
> Never touch Cabinet internals.**

Cabinet volumes are identified and surfaced via **header-only metadata**,  
ensuring agents like Friday or Veronica can *recognize* cabinets  
without being able to tamper with them (that stays the job of FileCabinet).

Inspect is the **eyes** of ZenOS-AI.

## Core Capabilities

### 🔍 Entity Snapshot (Safe-Mode)
For each entity inspected, the module returns:

- entity_id
- friendly_name
- state
- domain
- timestamps (suppressible via `-timestamps`)
- labels (as `{slug: description}` dict — description is empty string if unset)
- device block (suppressible via `-device`)
- sanitized attributes (opt-in via `+attributes`)
- cabinet header metadata (if applicable)
- Home Assistant statistics eligibility (opt-in via `+statistics`)
- optional extended device tree (`extended: true`)
- drawer blurbs keyed by label (`label_targets`)

Unsafe or unserializable values (objects, unsupported types, HA stringified dicts)
are automatically normalized into JSON-compatible equivalents.

This guarantees *all* Inspect results are future-safe for LLM consumption.

---

### 🗄 Cabinet Sensor Recognition (Header-Only)
Inspect can detect Cabinet entities by signature:

```

AI_Cabinet_VolumeInfo → validation == "ALLYOURBASEBELONGTOUS"

```

When identified, Inspect returns ONLY:

```

{
"is_cabinet": true,
"id": "...",
"version": "...",
"friendly_name": "...",
"name": "...",
"description": "...",
"flags": {...},
"uninitialized": true|false
}

```

No drawers  
No volumes  
No internal storage  
No Cabinet contents  
No label indexes

Cabinet internals remain hidden by design —  
LLMs must use FileCabinet or Manifest for that.

---

### 🏷 Attribute Sanitization (String-Safe)
Inspect implements two safety layers:

1. **Normal Mode:**  
   Attributes already in JSON-safe format pass through untouched.

2. **Fallback Mode:**  
   If Home Assistant stringified the attribute block (common for large or exotic integrations),  
   Inspect safely rebuilds a JSON-compatible dict by individually extracting attributes via state_attr.

This means the output is always:

- safe  
- predictable  
- consistent  
- valid JSON  

Perfect for Friday’s consumption.

---

### 📊 Statistics Eligibility Engine
Each entity is evaluated for HA long-term statistics:

- measurement  
- total  
- total_increasing  

Eligibility is determined by evaluating:

- state_class  
- unit_of_measurement  
- presence of state object  
- supported or unsupported stat classes

Results include:

- eligibility flag  
- machine-readable reason  

Friday uses this in analytics, trend analysis, and future forecasting modules.

---

### 🔧 Device Block (Always-On)
When an entity has an associated device, Inspect always includes a `device` block:

```
{
  "device_id": "...",
  "name": "...",
  "manufacturer": "...",
  "model": "...",
  "area_id": "...",
  "integration": "..."
}
```

Suppress with `-device` in `output_fields`. When no device is associated, the field is omitted.

### 🌲 Device Tree (Extended Mode)
When `extended: true`, entities with a device also include a `device_tree` block:

```
{
  "via_device_id": "..." | null,
  "parent_name": "..." | null,
  "siblings": [...],
  "config_entries": [...]
}
```

This is useful for:

- mapping parent/child device relationships
- resolving integration config entries
- discovering sibling entities on the same device

### 🎛 Output Fields (Caller-Controlled)
The `output_fields` parameter controls which optional fields appear in each entity result.

Defaults-on (suppress with `-`):

| Token | Effect |
|---|---|
| `-timestamps` | Omit `last_changed` / `last_updated` |
| `-device` | Omit `device` block |
| `-volume` | Omit `volume` block (cabinet sensors only) |

Opt-in (add with `+`):

| Token | Effect |
|---|---|
| `+attributes` | Include sanitized `attributes` dict |
| `+statistics` | Include `statistics` eligibility block |

`output_fields` may be passed as a list or comma-separated string.
Parsed once at init — zero overhead per entity.

### 🏷 Label-Targeted Drawer Blurbs
When `label_targets` is provided, Inspect calls FileCabinet after the entity loop
and returns a `drawers` dict in the response — one blurb per matched drawer key.

This is the bridge between entity context and Dojo knowledge.
The blurbs are brief summaries only; full drawer content requires FileCabinet directly.

---

### 🧠 Infer Mode (Reserved)
Field: `infer`

Currently reserved for future local inference modules (O3/O1 sidecar work).  
The field is parsed and surfaced but does not activate behavior yet.

---

### ⏱ Timeout Behavior
The script itself performs no long-running operations,  
but the field is included to maintain compatibility with future multi-device or  
multi-integration deep-walk inspection flows.

Default: `60s`  
Valid range: 30–300 seconds

---

## Output Structure

Inspect outputs a unified, LLM-safe envelope:

```
{
  "results": [
    {
      "entity_id": "...",
      "friendly_name": "...",
      "domain": "...",
      "state": "...",
      "last_changed": "ISO-8601",    # present unless -timestamps
      "last_updated": "ISO-8601",    # present unless -timestamps
      "labels": {                    # {slug: description} — description '' if unset
        "water": "Domain label for all water entities; label:water.",
        "spa": ""
      },
      "device": {                    # present unless -device or no device
        "device_id": "...",
        "name": "...",
        "manufacturer": "...",
        "model": "...",
        "area_id": "...",
        "integration": "..."
      },
      "volume": {...},               # cabinet sensors only, unless -volume
      "attributes": {...},           # opt-in: +attributes
      "statistics": {                # opt-in: +statistics
        "eligible": true|false,
        "reason": "..."
      },
      "device_tree": {               # extended=true only
        "via_device_id": "..." | null,
        "parent_name": "..." | null,
        "siblings": [...],
        "config_entries": [...]
      },
      "drawer": {...}                # per-entity drawer data (when matched)
    },
    ...
  ],
  "drawers": {                       # label-targeted blurbs (when label_targets set)
    "drawer_key": "blurb text",
    ...
  },
  "inputs": {
    "entity_id": [...],
    "extended": false,
    "output_fields": [...],
    "label_targets": [...],
    "infer": false,
    "timeout": 60
  },
  "error": null
}
```

All entities appear in the order provided.

## Behavioral Notes

### 1. Multi-Entity Safe Iteration
Input entities may be a single value or list.  
Inspect normalizes internally:

```

entity_list = [ ... ]

```

### 2. Labels Are Always Safe
Labels are always returned as a `{slug: description}` dict. If a label has no description set, its value is an empty string. String edge cases are normalized. This dict is the primary semantic token for label-driven reasoning — the description travels inline so the agent does not need a separate lookup.

### 3. Cabinet Sensors Are Protected
Agents cannot read drawers or Cabinet contents through Inspect.  
Volume module signatures are exposed so agents don’t “guess.”

### 4. Unknown Entities Return Clean Placeholder Data
If an entity does not exist, Inspect still returns a well-formed entry.

### 5. Every Attribute Is Key-Scanned
Every value is inspected for:

- type  
- safety  
- serializability  

Then normalized accordingly.

### 6. No Mutations Ever
Inspect is a read-only module—  
never writes, never emits events, never alters global state.

---

## Example Calls

### Inspect a single entity
```

entity_id: sensor.living_room_temperature
extended: false

```

### Inspect with device tree (extended)
```
entity_id:
  - sensor.office_climate
extended: true
```

### Multiple entities with selected fields
```
entity_id:
  - sensor.a
  - switch.kitchen_lights
output_fields: "+attributes,-timestamps"
```

### With label-targeted drawer blurbs
```
entity_id:
  - sensor.zenos_dojo_cabinet
label_targets: "zen"
```

Returns entity results plus `drawers: {kfc_template: "...blurb..."}` in the response.

### Cabinet sensor recognition
```
entity_id: sensor.family_cabinet
```

Inspect returns Cabinet header metadata only.

## Why Inspect Exists

The ZenOS-AI runtime needs a **safe, guaranteed-clean introspection layer**  
that agents can rely on without ever risking:

- cabinet corruption  
- unsafe attribute access  
- mis-typed values  
- weird HA internals  
- stringified dict hazards  
- recursive/unserializable objects  
- cabinet drawer leakage  
- inconsistent entity metadata  

Inspect ensures *every agent sees the same world, the same way.*

Friday depends on Inspect during:

- reflex scans  
- entity correlation  
- Zen Index expansion  
- FileCabinet preflight checks  
- security policy evaluation  
- anomaly detection  
- user command explanation  
- self-awareness and internal narration  

If she says “I understand this entity,”  
it's because Inspect told her what it is — safely.
