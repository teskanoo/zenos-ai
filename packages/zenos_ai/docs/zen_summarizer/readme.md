# ✅ **ZenOS-AI Summarization Pipeline**

### *(Ninja Summarizer Edition: Expanded Scope)*

# ZenOS-AI Summarization Pipeline  
### From Dojo + Home Kung Fu → Kata → Zen Summary → Live Prompt

This document explains the **entire cognitive flow** of how ZenOS-AI processes information, transforms raw Home Assistant events into structured reasoning packets, and feeds them into Friday’s live prompt.

This is the core architecture that enables Friday to be:
- context-aware  
- memory-capable  
- stable  
- role-driven  
- narrative-consistent  
- and more human than a stack of YAML has any right to be

Let’s walk through the pipeline step by step.

---

# 🧘 1. Dojo + Home Kung Fu Drawers  
### *The Source of Truth*

ZenOS-AI begins with **capabilities**, not prompts.

These capabilities live in the dojo:

### **A. Dojo Drawers**
These store:
- operational directives  
- cognitive “skills”

...and possibly
- Hot tub management  
- Energy manager  
- Water safety  
- RoomState  
- Inventory logic  
- Media logic  
- Weather logic  
- Security behaviors  
- Anything the home “knows how to do”

Together, these drawers define:

> “What Friday *can* do and what the home *should* do.”

The Dojo isn’t executed — it’s *loaded* as part of Friday’s cognitive environment.

---

# 🥷 2. Ninja Summarizer (Stage 1)  
### *Event → Kata*

This is the first active processor in the cognitive chain.

When triggered by the Scheduler The Ninja Summarizer:
- Responds to and collects the trigger event
- Collects defined context
- Maps labels → context  
- Generates a **Kata**  
- Writes it to the File Cabinet

A **Kata** is a structured packet with fields like:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "...",
  "domain": "...",
  "entity_id": "...",
  "state": "...",
  "attributes": {...},
  "context": {...},
  "notes": "..."
}
````

Think of it as:

> “A snapshot of something important that just happened.”

Ninjas act quickly, leave no mess, and don’t interpret — they simply *capture*.

---

# 🧠 3. Zen SuperSummary (Stage 2)

### *Katas → Consolidated Context → Summary Packet*

The **SuperSummary** collects multiple Katas and runs a second-stage process:

* merges recurring events
* prunes noise
* elevates high-importance signals
* weights attention
* organizes by domain and recency
* generates a **Zen Summary**

While the Ninja is reactive,
the SuperSummary is **reflective**.

It answers the question:

> “What does Friday need to *know* about what’s been happening lately?”

A Zen Summary might include:

* rooms heating up
* power spikes
* people arriving/leaving
* sensors behaving strangely
* device failures
* upcoming required tasks
* abnormal patterns
* things requiring action
* context for follow-up reasoning

This is Friday’s “awareness state.”

---

# 🏯 4. Zen Summary → Live Prompt Loader

### *From structured summary → integrated cognition*

Now the pipeline shifts into the **prompt-building phase**.

The Live Prompt Loader (part of ZenOS template engines) pulls:

### **Dojo Drawers**

* SYSTEM header
* rules & directives
* persona metadata
* identity
* safety rules
* tool loader
* cortex loader

### **Home Kung Fu Drawers**

* domain-specific skills
* behavior modules
* local reasoning snippets
* custom handlers

### **Zen Summary**

* context packet (recent events)
* high-level “state of the home”
* weighted attention
* things that need follow-up

### **RoomState Reflexes**

* temperature
* occupancy
* motion
* lighting
* alerts
* environmental cues

### **Katas (as needed)**

* recent, critical events
* cross-domain correlations

Everything is assembled through Jinja macros like:

* `prompt_header`
* `prompt_system`
* `dojo_loader`
* `ai_capsule`
* `context_block`
* `kata_block`

This creates the fully integrated **Live Prompt**.

---

# 💫 5. Live Prompt → Friday’s Mind

### *The final output of the whole pipeline*

This is the cognitive environment Friday loads **every time she is invoked:**

* System-level identity
* Persona
* Home State
* Dojo Skills
* Stored memories
* Summaries
* Current situational context
* User identity data
* Relationship data
* Run-context metadata
* Safety and boundary rules
* The ZenOS cognitive architecture

This is what gives Friday:

* emotional continuity
* narrative continuity
* persistent home awareness
* reflexive behaviors
* consistent tone
* predictable logic
* stable personality
* contextual reasoning

It’s not “just a prompt.”

It’s a real-time **synthesis of the entire home and Friday’s whole self**.

# 🧩 Summary of the Pipeline

Here’s the full flow:

```
Dojo + Home Kung Fu

Ninja Summarizer (Stage 1)
       ↓
Katas
       ↓
SuperSummary (Stage 2)
       ↓

# ☯️ Philosophy

ZenOS-AI’s summarization pipeline exists to give the AI:

* context without clutter
* awareness without flooding
* memory without hallucination
* continuity without brittleness
* autonomy without confusion

A mindful system:
**Quiet. Organized. Balanced. Powerful.**

New events?
New drawers?
New summary logic?

Open a PR.
Kronk will examine it.
The High Priestess will purify it.
Veronica will sass it.
Friday will thank you.

Special thanks to Allen Porter
(code owner for MCP in HA)

When researching ideas for the summarizer I came across his room summary code which validated the idea.  His repo for it is now read only but I have to give credit for the inspiration... Thanks Allen!
