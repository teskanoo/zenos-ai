      Zen AdminTools KungFu Writer v1.5.2 — creates or updates structured Kung Fu
      component drawers in the Zen Dojo Cabinet.  Each component defines how a
      subsystem behaves, what data it depends on, and which entity controls it.
      Think of this script as the pen the monks use to write new katas for Friday.

            🥋 **Zen AdminTools KungFu Writer v1.5.0 — The Dojo Scribe**
    
            --- **Purpose** Create or update a fully structured Kung Fu component
            drawer inside the Zen Dojo Cabinet.  Each drawer defines a complete
            subsystem of the smart home: how it works, what it depends on, and how
            Friday, Kronk, and the Monks should reason about it.  Think of a drawer
            as a lesson plan for a sensei teaching a new kata — clarity, precision,
            and insight matter.
    
            --- **What It Builds**
              • Writes a JSON object containing roughly 12 core keys
                (`command`, `component_instructions`, `friendly_name`, etc.)
              • Packages it under the selected `drawer` name within the `cabinet`,
                together with an ISO 8601 timestamp.
              • Calls FileCabinet to validate and index the new data, making it visible
                to the Library, Index, and Monastery summarizers for reasoning.
    
            --- **How Much to Write**
              • *Short fields* — `summary`, `friendly_name`, `label`: 1 concise line each.
              • *component_instructions* — rich prose of 10–40 lines.  Describe sensors,
                normal operation, failure states, inferences, and alert logic.  You may
                embed small YAML or list sections for clarity.
              • *more_info* — 1–3 paragraphs giving broader context, safety rationale, or
                design philosophy.
              • *required_context* — short list or sentence of dependencies (entities,
                integrations, or data sources).
              • Avoid excessive size (>4 KB); split long documentation into a Library
                module if needed and reference it.
              • End each major section with a plain English sentence — it helps the
                summarizers interpret intent.
    
            --- **Example: Component “foo_manager”**
              ```
              command: "~FOO~"
              component_instructions: >-
                Monitors Foo-level energy flow for the Foo Subsystem.
                Alerts when foo sensors report deviation from expected thresholds.
                Typical triggers:
                  - binary_sensor.foo_sensor_connected: -off- indicates lost sensor link.
                  - sensor.foo_level_high: value > 80 triggers overflow protection.
                Expected recovery:
                  - Resume normal mode when foo_level < 60 for 5 consecutive minutes.
                Inferences:
                  - When Foo flow rises during absence, infer possible leak condition.
                  - Cross-reference RoomState to avoid false positives during laundry.
                Rules:
                  - Do not report flow when any Foo connectivity sensor is offline.
              component_summary: >-
                Manages Foo subsystem behavior and safety monitoring.
              friendly_name: Foo Manager
              label: Foo Manager
              master_switch: input_boolean.foo_manager_master_switch
              more_info: >-
                Foo Manager coordinates the Foo sensors to safeguard the Foo subsystem
                against overflow and system imbalance.  It reports to the Energy and
                Water Managers for holistic monitoring.
              priority: reflex
              required_context: Requires foo flow sensors and occupancy context.
              version: 2.0.0
              ```
              When committed, this becomes a fully functional Dojo drawer
              (`zen_kungfu_cabinet.foo_manager`) that the Monastery can load,
              summarize, and reason upon.
    
            --- **Behavior**
              • `action: help` → Displays this guide and halts — safe to run anytime.
              • `action: write` + `confirm_action: true` → Creates or overwrites the
                specified drawer using `script.zen_dojotools_filecabinet`.
              • `action: write` + `confirm_action: false` → Aborts with a gentle warning.
              • Returns a structured JSON response suitable for DojoTools LogViewer and
                Monastery reflection.
    
            --- **Best Practices**
              • Write in clear, natural language; the monks summarize your words for
                Friday’s context window — not raw YAML.
              • Verify that entity IDs (especially `master_switch`) exist before commit.
              • Keep consistent version numbering and casing (semantic versioning).
              • Each drawer is both documentation *and* operational code — clarity equals
                reliability.
              • When describing alerts, always specify both normal and failure states.
    
            --- **Proverb of the Dojo** “When the scribe writes clearly, the system
            acts wisely.”
